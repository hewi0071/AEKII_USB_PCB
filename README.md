# AEKII_USB_PCB
Updated PCB for Apple Extended Keyboard II using an STM32

### Schematics

Schematics drawn to match the original housing of the AEK II board (possibly suiting the AEK as well), and and also include a onboard USB for programming or use in other cases if wanted.

The PCB uses the basis of the STM32 Blackpill 3.0 board as the controller. Most of the board has been updated to remove the majority of the development functions such as buttons and LEDs. These were removed to there being only 1 use for this board, and the required extra I/O for the size of a fullsize keyboard.
